# SVM hyperparameter Optimization

This project involves optimizing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using the Optuna library for hyperparameter tuning on a multi-class dataset. The main objective is to achieve the best classification accuracy by systematically tuning the SVM's kernel, `C`, and `gamma` values.

## Methodology

### Dataset Selection & Preprocessing

- A multi-class dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was used.
- Dataset size: ~5,000 to 30,000 samples
- The dataset was split into 10 random train-test sets (70% train, 30% test), labeled from `S1` to `S10`.

### Model & Optimization Strategy

- Classifier: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Hyperparameter tuning performed using [Optuna](https://optuna.org/)
- Parameters optimized:
  - `kernel`: `'rbf'` or `'poly'`
  - `C`: Regularization parameter
  - `gamma`: Kernel coefficient (for both `rbf` and `poly`)
- Each split was optimized for 100 iterations using `study.optimize()` from Optuna.

---

## Evaluation Strategy

For each of the 10 splits:
- Recorded best test accuracy
- Logged best hyperparameter combination
- The sample with the highest accuracy was chosen for detailed convergence graph analysis

## Convergence Graph â€“ Best Sample: `S4`

This graph shows the progression of accuracy over 100 optimization trials using Optuna.  

- Blue dots represent accuracy values for each trial.
- Red line shows the best-so-far accuracy (running maximum).

> The optimization converged rapidly within the first 20 iterations, eventually reaching an optimal test accuracy of 66.88%.
